## Yuichi Hirose

I am a PhD student in [Carnegie Mellon University]â€™s [Robotics Institute], advised by [Jim McCann] in the [Textiles Lab]. My research interest lies in digital fabrication, particularly in *[solid knitting]*, a new fabrication technique to knit dense, volumetric objects, which I invented. I am developing a *[solid knitting machine]* to automate the process.

I hold an undergraduate and a master's degree from Keio University Shonan Fujisawa Campus, where I was advised by [Hiroya Tanaka], and have worked as a mechanical engineer developing 3D milling machines at [Roland DG].
